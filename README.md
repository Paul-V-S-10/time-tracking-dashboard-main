## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned several key concepts and skills:

- **Responsive Design**: I implemented a mobile-first approach using Flexbox and CSS Grid to ensure the layout adapts to various screen sizes, providing a seamless experience across devices.
  
  
- **CSS Variables**: Using CSS custom properties (variables) made it easier to manage and adjust the color scheme and layout in a flexible and efficient way.

- **Styled Components**: Styled-components allowed me to write scoped CSS directly within my React components, which made my code more modular and maintainable.

Hereâ€™s an example of how I used React state to switch between stats:

```js
const [timeframe, setTimeframe] = useState('daily');

const handleChange = (event) => {
  setTimeframe(event.target.value);
};
